                <p>Artist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/t-magazine/art/anicka-yi.html">Anicka Yi imagines</a> machines that have &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; &mdash; but not in an anthropomorphic sense. These machines have sensorial intelligence and evolve independently from humans &mdash; in a manner that is &ldquo;neither antagonistic, dystopian nor utopian&rdquo;. Working with the concept of Artificial Physical Intelligence, or API (as opposed to Artificial General Intelligence or AGI) conceived by philosopher Tobias Rees and roboticist and machine learning expert Hans Peter Brondmo, Yi refers to them as &lsquo;biological machines&rsquo;. From the description (reference pending) of her upcoming commission for the Tate Modern&rsquo;s Turbine Hall in October 2020 API is described as: &ldquo;emerg[ing] from being a body in the world, from engaging with other life forms, from the senses, the cells, and the microbiome&rdquo; (Rees, personal communication). Yi builds complex artworks that combine diverse fields such as molecular biology, geochemistry, perfumery and machine learning that reach towards the sensorium of such machines. They can be difficult to describe without actually experiencing; this may be part of what she intends. In<a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/art/2019/partecipants/anicka-yi"> Biologizing the Machine</a><a href="https://bagrifoundation.org/anicka-yi-la-biennale-di-venezia/"> (Terra Incognita)</a> at the 2019 Venice Biennale, Yi&rsquo;s team installed mud from the city in acrylic vitrines together with bacteria that emitted a particular smell. The smell was being &lsquo;learned&rsquo; by a machine learning system. Over time, and with changes in light, humidity and temperature, the bacteria interacted with other organisms in the soil, creating a vivid pigmentation visible in the vitrines. Thus the work captures the smell, the mud, the machine and time itself in communication with each other.<a href="https://soundcloud.com/e_flux/anicka-yi-on-various-ecologies"> Talking with Elvia Wilk</a>, Yi says that API &ldquo;is not about making them [machines] similar to humans but let[ting] them evolve as their own species.&rdquo; Wilk notes that we are already in a time when many technologies that we consider smart or intelligent are about machines communicating with each other; consider for example, QR codes, two factor authentication, the Internet of Things, and natural language processing applications.</p>
