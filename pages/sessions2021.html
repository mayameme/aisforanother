            <h3>New talks to inspire more entries for the dictionary</h3>
            <p><em>A Is For Another </em>sparks reflection in how we think about what AI is, and what else it might be.
                A creative-pedagogical platform and resource for learners (and teachers) from diverse traditions, it
                expands knowledge about how we think about AI; how we think about making connections between different
                domains of knowledge about AI. This dictionary does not assemble theories for a new computational
                approach to AI, rather, it inspires the (re)imagination of this technology through diverse epistemes and
                epistemologies.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The first iteration of <em>A Is For</em> was based on contributions from participants in response to a
                public seminar about AI at the Berlin-based <a href="https://schoolofdisobedience.net/about/">School of
                    Disobedience</a> in Winter 2020. This next iteration will take place a little differently: as a
                series of public talks online serving as prompts and provocations for short dictionary entries that any
                talk attendee can author.</p>
            <p>We are thrilled to host talks by Pedro Oliveira (13/4), Nelly Y. Pinkrah (28/4), and Mushon Zer Aviv
                (29/4). All talks are open to the public and will be hosted on Big Blue Button, a web-based video
                platform that requires no installation. More information below about talks and speakers, registration,
                and how to contribute to the dictionary.&nbsp;</p>

                    grant</a> from the Mellon-Sawyer Histories of AI Seminar at the University of Cambridge, we can
                expand <em>A Is For Another</em> by paying our speakers, developer Pratyush Raman, event organiser Teena
                Lange, and four contributors.&nbsp;</p>
            <h1>The talks</h1>
            <h2>From machine &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to &ldquo;machine&rdquo; listening by Pedro Oliveira. April 13, 14h
                Central European Time</h2>
            <p>Pedro&rsquo;s talk will start with describing his <a href="https://oliveira.work/">recent artistic
                    research</a> practice about the German government&rsquo;s past and current experiments with
                accent/dialect classification and recognition technologies. Since 2017 the German Federal Office for
                Migration and Refugees systematically applies these technologies to help verify asylum seekers&rsquo;
                identities and determine the validity of their claims; however, the history of Germany&rsquo;s attempt
                to connect language and identity stretches over a century towards the past. Oliveira will connect these
                histories of listening to speech with the current fascination with AI as an attempt to replicate human
                sensing and perception, or &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo;. He argues that rather than AI&rsquo;s attempt to
                overcome human listening, the problem is more fundamental: That AI seeks to understand what &lsquo;the
                human&rsquo; is by constituting that the voice is anchored to the body, and that the body is the sole
                responsible for determining &lsquo;human-ness&rsquo;. Drawing on the work of Sylvia Wynter and Denise
                Ferreira da Silva, Oliveira will discuss how the aural history of colonialism has aided in the
                construction of &lsquo;the human&rsquo;. And if human-ness is more than speaking and listening, then
                what is it? To think &lsquo;the human&rsquo; and human intelligence beyond quantifiable sensing and
                perception, Oliveira leads us through insights offered by Gloria Anzald&uacute;a into thinking from, as,
                and within the border to complicate the boundaries of voice, accent, speech, and listening.

            <h2>&Eacute;douard Glissant, the grapevine, and the ocean By Nelly Y Pinkrah. April 28, 14h Central European
                Time.</h2>
            <p>In my work, I am tracing what I refer to as the &lsquo;technogenetic&rsquo; substances of
                &Eacute;douard Glissant&rsquo;s thinking and writing to understand the disruptive histories of race,
                media (and) technology that inform contemporary life. I will set the scene by taking us to the secret
                communication networks of the Haitian Revolution that are expressed, and embodied even, in the title of
                Julius Scott&rsquo;s brilliant book &raquo;The Common Wind&laquo; (2018). In the imperialists&rsquo;
                communications control this common wind caused a disruption, and by means of Glissantian terms I want to
                show how to rethink histories of media (and) technology, and thus contemporary imaginaries of what it
                means to relate, and form a commons. This work attempts to diffract the histories that underlie media
                technologies such as AI and how we believe they narrate stories about us.</p>

            <h2>Recalculating route by Mushon Zer-Aviv. April 29, 17h Central European Time.</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;Recalculating route&rdquo; the synthetic voice says, as the navigation app detects that the driver
                has strayed off the shortest path it predicted. It queries the server and suggests a new route, and with
                it a new ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival). Mushon Zer-Aviv, who previously designed maps for Waze, argues
                that a lot is happening within these few moments between the driver&rsquo;s disobedient turn, and the
                new path and ETA predicted by the app. In this talk he will discuss this adversarial negotiation between
                driver and app/algorithm as a unique matter of dialogue, and agency. Mushon will also talk about the
                case of political disinformation bots in Israel, and the &lsquo;Shabbos Goy&rsquo; as different
                metaphors of AI, and the shaky boundaries between how we classify the &lsquo;human&rsquo;, and the
                &lsquo;machine&rsquo;. </p>

            <h1>About contributing an entry to the dictionary</h1>
            <p>Written contributions to the dictionary are not just summaries of the talks. Each entry is the
                contributor&rsquo;s own reflection as prompted by the talk, and written with the intention of clarifying
                or going deeper into a topic. Think of it as &lsquo;paying forward&rsquo; your understanding and
                knowledge to someone else who wants to learn. Anyone can contribute an entry, however, only four
                contributions of 400-500 words can be remunerated Eur 50 each. We particularly invite students to
                contribute entries. Dictionary entries typically take a few weeks to put together. Each entry will be
                edited for consistency. Be in touch with Maya (<a
